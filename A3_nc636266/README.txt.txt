iii. One paragraph summary of the website that I developed

       My goal is to make my first personal website. This website aims is to promote myself in order to increase recognition, 
hence increase the number of people that know me or recruit me. This aim can be achieved through the design and info present in 
the website. This website has a navigation bar to several other web pages with different category of content. This will ease people that 
visit my website to absorb and find information. It will also not be boring for them, since it is not just 1 long web page that looks 
like a novel with lots of words. There are 4 web pages in the navigation. They are homepage, music, CS, and credits. In the home pageâ€™s 
heading, there is my full name written using a large font. This will ease the people that visits my website to remember my name. 
There is also a portrait of me in the home page. This will enable all the people that visit my website to know what I look like 
or recognize me. There is also info about the aims of the website, about me, my hobbies, my education, and my contact information 
in the footer. In the music web page, there are pictures and info of different types of piano, and what piano I used. There is 
also a video of me playing a piano cover of a pop music, as well as an audio player of the original music. In the CS web page, 
there is a description of why I choose to study computer science, as well as a YouTube video that inspires me to study computer 
science. This YouTube video explain what is computer science. There is also a code I write bymyself that can solve a problem in 
the CS webpage. In the credits webpage, I include all the links of materials that are not mines, and I took from the internet.
